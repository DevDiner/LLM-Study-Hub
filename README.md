# LLM-Study-Hub

LLM-Study-Hub is a curated and continuously updated repository compiling the latest insights, research, and technical findings related to Large Language Models (LLMs). This hub serves as a knowledge base for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts exploring the evolving LLM landscape.

---

## Overview

This repository provides deep dives into:

- **LLM Inner Workings**: Architectures, training techniques, scaling laws, and inference optimization.
- **A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent)**: Communication protocols and frameworks between AI agents.
- **AI Agents**: Design and deployment of autonomous agents powered by LLMs.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Hybrid systems that combine retrieval and generation for grounded, factual outputs.
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Theory and practice for fine-tuning LLMs on specific tasks or domains.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Broader foundational topics and tools relevant to NLP and LLM development.
